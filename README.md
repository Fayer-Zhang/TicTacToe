# TicTacToe

## General Introduction
This project is going to implement the game Tic-Tac-Toe. The game itself is fairly simple and well-known game. You can brush up [your Tic-Tac-Toe skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

The ultimate goal is to program a machine-learning algorithm that will learn how to be a good Tic-Tac-Toe player automatically. The project will base the approach on a paper published by Donald Michie in 1961 in Science Survey, titled Trial and error. That paper has been reprinted in the book On Machine Intelligence and can be found on page 11 at the following URL:

For a more modern take of the same idea, you can also watch

The whole project is divided into 4 steps(version) and  each version has its own README.md.
